# Bluechip-AI Hackathon Submission

## Overview  
Bluechip-AI hackathon is an annual conference held every year in Lagos state, Nigeria. The repository contains the submission for the 2024 hackathon which is a machine learning model designed for loan prediction using a **Random Forest** classifier. The model analyzes various features to predict loan approval outcomes.

## Model Performance  
- **Training Accuracy:** 83.9%  
- **Test Accuracy:**  
  - 30% test split → **83.9%**  
  - 70% test split → **83.4%**  

## How It Works  
1. **Data Processing:** The model processes structured loan data to extract meaningful insights.  
2. **Model Training:** A Random Forest classifier is trained on labeled data.  
3. **Evaluation:** The model’s performance is assessed using accuracy metrics.  
4. **Prediction:** Once trained, the model predicts loan approvals for new data points.
